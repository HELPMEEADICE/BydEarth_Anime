 FRA_elodie_batteux_desc: "艾洛蒂出身名门望族，她的血脉可追溯到远至大灾变千年前的法国和意大利尊贵而享有特权的精英阶层。不过，她家族的威望和影响力并非来自千年的世袭，而是来自家族在农业、食品加工、制药和纺织业等领域积累的巨额财富，这些财富是在过去两个世纪中积累起来的。\n\n艾洛蒂出生在欧洲最顶尖的妇产医院——一座位于布拉加的医院，她是父母的独生女。她在蔚蓝海岸和太阳海岸的奢华环境中长大，十几岁时就成为媒体宠儿，尽管并非总是以一种讨人喜欢的方式出现。艾洛蒂被反对者指责为孤立主义者和欧洲精英主义者，她确实以犀利的言辞和机敏的头脑而闻名。作为西方文化传统价值的坚定信仰者，她认为受过教育的欧洲精英阶层有责任引导大众，以确保高雅文化的存续。\n\n在地球上达成这一目标的最佳路径，便是促成新联盟的独立和可持续发展。"

 franco_event.7.t: "英格兰内战"
 franco_event.7.d: "Of all the areas of opposing interests in Europe, England is perhaps the most contentious and multi-sided. For decades, England has been on a steady downhill slide into poverty and squalour following their losses in the Dark Days and a subsequent half-century of corrupt inaction by the current government, leading the majority of the English population to openly oppose the ruling system. Unfortunately, this widespread opposition has become common knowledge among our rivals, and the outbreak of violence has resulted in a four-sided conflict across the nation.\n\nIn the north and east, the remnants of the old English government have held onto strategic control, and direct Scottish intervention is not expected, given fears of escalation into a wider conflict. In the east, an ecological front has opened up, filled mostly with youths and students, and no doubt supported by INTEGR across the sea. In the far south just over the channel, a small and independent force of militia has seized several locations, but are expected to soon be overwhelmed by their enemies and are of little concern to us.\n\nIn the English 'Home Counties', however, is where our investments lie. A retired English general by the name of Nigel John-Hall leads a paramilitary clique of what can best be described as technophobes, authoritarians and luddites in all but name. While we are loath to associate ourselves with a populist dictator and his hate-filled rabble, we are willing to accept the ideological differences to gain a stake on the British Isles, and this John-Hall will likely prove himself an effective leashed dog, if nothing else.\n\nWe must be careful how far we intervene, however. England is a hotbed of strongly opposing interests, and because of this, direct intervention is out of the question."

I’m just amazed you’ve not used a video caller before.\" Élodie furrowed her brow and carried on with the ‘conversation’. \"So, I’ve heard you’ve managed to take control of England, yes?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" It came out more of a murmur.\n\n\"We have a selection of topics to discuss then. First things first, I assume this is a given, but do you plan on staying a part of our sphere, alliance, whatever you may call it? I know England isn’t on the mainland, but I would assume you’d like to ascend to some greater European state or alliance in the future?\"\n\"No love, that’s simply not going to happen, you see-\"\n\"Please, just stop right there. Our relationship can’t go only one way, we need to see commitment from you too.\"\n\"Well of course it can go one way, I’m not into birds.\" John-Hall gave himself a wry chuckle, Élodie gave him a disgusted glare.\n\n\"You’ve attempted to try and wriggle out of responsibility in our previous messages, I’ve tried to be lenient with your demands before, but they are simply unrealistic. A united Europe must include Britain to be truly legitimate.\"\n \"No no no no, your demands are unrealistic, England can’t survive under a united Europe, your mechanisms and contraptions will corrupt our people and force them out of work!\" Nigel’s face turned as red as his suit.\n\nÉlodie lifted her head and replied. \"You won’t survive against the NSA without our help and protection, we can give you some autonomy and allow you to make some decisions, you have a relatively good taste in culture and strategy for an Englishman.\"\n\"For an Englishman?\"\n\"However, on political and economic matters, we strongly advise that you defer to our advisors. No co-operation, no protection, no economic assistance. And yes, we will try and hold off on exporting machinery and technology to England for now. But you must keep your end of the deal. Also keep your men in better order, we already have enough on our hands with the Romanians.\"\n\nJohn-Hall grumbled dejectedly before nodding and ending the call.

 franco_event.10.t: "Italian Invasion"
 franco_event.10.d: "Ever since Padania seceded from Italy over 40 years ago by referendum, the peninsula has become a slowly boiling pot of tension as the Italian government and populace grew resentful of their new, wealthier northern neighbour. Acquati’s Partito Sociale government has further fanned anti-Padania sentiment - now culminating in a full-scale Italian invasion.\n\n Padania has sought to portray itself as a eco_socialism beacon of progress in the 23rd century, but the invasion leaves them no room to reject our aid. Though they may be hesitant now, securing the allegiance of Padania through its defence will be one step further to realizing European unity\n\nWe must beware of our extent of support, however, as our rivals move to oppose us in the south. The Germans – and the wider INTEGR alliance – have an interest in supporting the Italian government. We will be watching closely to ensure our rivals do not get too involved in the conflict – as they will surely be doing with us."

Padania will undoubtedly fall to rival influence were it to succeed in its defence, and in these times of tension and diplomatic manoeuvring, we cannot allow that to happen.\n\nItaly will be far more open to our new government, and will be much more receptive to our aid, but we must take care.

 franco_event.12.d: "When the world advanced past the 21st century, many hoped the days of anarchy were over. But like those who entered the 21st century from the 20th, they were wrong. Events that would occur once in a lifetime now happened weekly. And of course, it was the media’s job to inform the public of what was going on. And to make a buck from it.\n“Okay, are we rolling?... Hello, this is Liane Noyer of FLNN live from the streets of Strasbourg near the German border. The situation here is…dangerous to say the least.” Noyer stepped aside, allowing her viewers to see what was happening. One could easily compare it to the Catalonian riots of the 21st century.\nFire ruled the streets, Cars and automated delivery vehicles were wrecked, dented with steel poles and bats. Windows smashed with rocks, bricks, and even a few Molotov Cocktails. Whatever rioters could get their hands on, they threw. Behind the reporter, lines of riot police marched forward, shields and batons at the ready. A wall against the tidal wave of rioters.\n“No official word had been given about the cause of this unrest, though unverified sources have claimed it has originated from an environmental protest against industrial expansion in this region. Possibly in response to the construction of a large state-run factory complex on the outskirts of the city. The largest of the environmental groups that operate in Strasbourg, known as ‘Locals Against Exploitation’ or ‘LAE’, is believed to have ties to INTEGR. If this group is responsible, then could this be a sign of efforts by foreign powers to foment insurrection within our borders? Only time can tell. This is Liane Noyer of FLNN-”\n\nBANG!\n\n Noyer and her cameramen immediately ducked, and any sense of stability in the footage died as it blurred from the rapid movement. The camera managed to focus on the line of riot police. Chaos expanded rapidly now, the once stable line barely held together. As rioters rammed against the shield wall, the police responded with batons and tear gas.\n\nBANG! BANG!\n\nMore shots ring true, as Noyer ran with her camera following closely.\n “I…I can’t believe it!” She said frantically, barely able to speak as she ran, “Shots have been fired! I repeat shots have been-”\nBZZT.\nStatic ruled the screens for a moment, before returning to the studio. Those sitting comfortably in the office gave half sincere words of hope before they returned to their scheduled programming. But it was in everyone’s minds now; the people saw what happened. Theories formed in minutes, and by the end of the hour, entire chat groups were dedicated to placing blame. But whether it was the rioters or the police, everyone shared the same thought about whom they believed were responsible."

 franco_event.13.d: "As two rather poor and malnourished fisherman looked out to the sea, their catch of the day neared. It had taken one’s money, another’s food and destroyed their livelihoods. They would not come home hungry nor poor after this. Their catch of the day was a Franco-Iberian commercial trawler, one that had long driven them off, taken their fish and their livelihoods. The Maghreb might have been too weak to drive the Franco-Iberians off due to their own political instability but someone had to fill the void left by the coastguard.\n\nIt was now or never, in a small fishing boat they pulled alongside and before the Franco-Iberians could try to scare them away, they pulled out their semi-automatic rifles and opened fire. The ship turned away from the sudden gunfire, but another small boat which was following up from the otherside, moving closer while the Franco-Iberian’s attention was on the compatriots opening fire as a distraction.\n\nOf course, the relatively unarmed Franco-Iberian hadn’t expected such a sudden escalation, and beyond some pistol fire not much came in way of resistance. The Franco-Iberians had been used to being virtually unopposed as they fished in Maghrebi waters while their government struggled.\n\nGuiding their new hostages to the lower deck of the ship, the pirates set a course home, smiling all the while amongst themselves. Those Franco-Iberians want to take their fish, and their livelihoods they’re more than welcome to try."
