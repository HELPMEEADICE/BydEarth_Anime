 PRU_the_andean_century: "The Andean Century"
 PRU_the_andean_century_desc: "The century turns yet again, but the Andes stand tall. The world is crumbling under the pressure of ancient struggles and climate change, but the Andean Compact is stronger than ever. Bolstered by international investors, vast energy reserves, a literate population and good geography, the Compact is widely recognized as a world power. The citizens of the Compact enjoy many social, economic, and technological freedoms that are rare in other parts of the world. The Compact is in its golden age - and it's going to last."
 PRU_the_lithium_business: "The Lithium Business"
 PRU_the_lithium_business_desc: "Old Peru and Old Bolivia are home to some of the world's largest lithium reserves. Monopolized by local indegenous groups, the Lithium trade is one of the pillars on which the entire Compact rests. While international trade isn't quite as extensive as in pre-Mistake times, the export of lithium has made the Andes rich and powerful."
 PRU_economic_decentralization_crippling: "Economic Decentralization: §RCrippling§!"
 PRU_economic_decentralization_crippling_desc: "As of now, major corporations and interest groups control this country's economy. The government has little say on where to build, what to build, and when to build it. Any and all legislation is instantly met with a flurry of push backs and filibustering, while the parties are too busy fighting one another to form a united front."
 PRU_military_decentralization_extensive: "Military Decentralization: §RExtensive§!"
 PRU_military_decentralization_extensive_desc: "As of now, this country's military is partially under the control of corporations and interest groups. The government has limited control over a patchwork of militias, mercenaries, and a few official divisions whose loyalty is a little more than questionable. On the plus side, companies fund and equip their own forces out of pocket."
 peru.1.title: "The Compact\"s Army"
 peru.1.desc: "A comprehensive army review, compiled by High Command and assisted by international advisors, has revealed the following about our land and air forces:\n\n-The Compact has insufficient manpower to wage modern war. Conscription will become necessary sooner or later.\n-The Compact\"s industry is completely unprepared for total war. Heavy emphasis on light industry by previous administrations has left major gaps in military infrastructure.\n-There are insufficient armored and air vehicles to compete with global powers. However, local opponents like Brazil are estimated to be weaker in that regard, at least for now.\n-The Compact lacks proper orbital-air-land interoperability. This is partly due to an inexperienced officer corps but can be rectified by combat simulations.\n\nIn total, the Compact\"s armies have potential, but are currently limited. Analysts agree that the current force is sufficient to carry the Compact through continental conflicts but dramatic expansion is necessary to attain global reach."
 peru.1.a: "We must prepare for war."
 peru.2.title: "The Southern Conflict"
 peru.2.desc: "Down South, the Argentines are fighting tooth and nail for their blasted land. Refugees are swarming into our lower outposts and threaten to overrun critical military installations. It may be in our interest to help one side end the civil war… or we can supply all participants to make sure that Argentina remains divided and weak."
 peru.2.a: "Help the Grand Council."
 peru.2.b: "The military government must not fall!"
 peru.2.c: "Play them against one another."
 peru.3.title: "Overtures From The Compact?"
 peru.3.desc: "The Andean Compact to our North has sent a delegation asking for the establishment of an official embassy in our capital. While the Compact has been widely accused of being self-serving and opportunistic, it can be a valuable ally and protector in these hard times. It will also allow for future trade deals to fix our economy."
 peru.3.a: "Agreed"
 peru.3.b: "We don't need this"
 peru.4.title: "Argentina Accepts Embassy"
 peru.4.desc: "Good news! The wise Argentine nation has accepted our overtures and we now have an embassy in their capital. Diplomatic relations are expected to improve from this point on and we can count them as an ally to the Compact."
 peru.4.a: "Good"
 peru.5.title: "Argentina Rejects Embassy"
 peru.5.desc: "Despite our best overtures, the Argentine government has declined to host our embassy in their capital. Citing war profiteering, corruption, and other unfounded reasons, the Argentines have insulted us. We must view them as a potential enemy from this point on."
 peru.5.a: "Their loss"
