 PAD_homeland_ofthe_rich_desc: "Success breeds more success, as some would say, and it is definitely not a falsehood in Padania. With its newly gained independence came thousands of rich investors and entrepreneurial from all corners of the globe.\n\nIn essence, Padania was a second Switzerland of old, a haven for multi-billion dollar conglomerates and a prime headquarters for CEOs and international banking, with money flowing out in the streets. Some gaze up at Padania with disguised envy or furious hatred, but none can doubt the nation's limitless prosperity."
 PAD_matteo_bossi: "Matteo Bossi"
 PAD_matteo_bossi_desc: "Born in Padania before Padania existed, Matteo Bossi is a man of principle. Never seen without a sharp business suit and a spark in his eye, both friends and enemies describe him as innovative and honest, a pioneer in the construction business. Truly, before coming to political office, Matteo inherited a modest contractor firm from his father, a fervent Padanian nationalist. Within ten years, his company had become the go-to on most industrial projects throughout Europe.\n\nFolding his assets in 2183 to run for Novara mayor, Matteo was seen as a symbol of Padania, a success story in spite of the corrupt Italians and overbearing Franco-Iberians. Now, Matteo Bossi turns his eyes inward. Padania is free, yes, but there are many challenges to overcome. With his sights set on the sky and riding a wave of popular support, Matteo Bossi hopes to see Padania become a paradise, and will stop at nothing to see his homeland be truly independent."

 padania_event.1.t: "The Godless Socialists"
 padania_event.1.d: "Today, our great president made a fiery, brilliant speech, denouncing Italy as a communist dictatorship, squashing human rights, both economical and political, in the name of their totalitarian system. Of course, some critics insist that this evaluation is false. They are wrong about that, but they have full right to use their rights unlike our neighboring socialist tyranny. It is important for us to remember what makes Padania different from Italy. And what makes us better."
 padania_event_option.1.a: "Ain't he right?"
 padania_event.2.t: "Italy declares war on us!"
 padania_event.2.d: "Padanian territory has historically been known as Northern Italy. Of course, it has been a little more than 200 years since then, 200 years of independence. We have different ideals, different governments, different cultures, and different paths as countries. Albeit, Italy themselves cannot accept this fact, and have sent us a formal declaration of war! With their forces mobilizing and crossing the border, we have no choice but to defend ourselves with everything we've got, or else Padania will cease to exist."
