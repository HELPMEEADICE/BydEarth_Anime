 KAR_parliament: "卡累利阿议会"
 KAR_parliament_desc: "The Parliament of Karjala, founded in the wake of the Spring Coup, is composed of Finnish and Russian representatives, led by a Speaker from each side. Although many political and ideological lines exist, the government (and the nation as a whole) is divided by nationality. Finnish migrants have already outpaced the native Slavs in population, but the latter maintains control over many businesses and the army.\n\nThe Karjala Parliament is at a crossroads. On the one hand, it has many internal issues, such as agricultural insecurity, poverty, migration and a high crime rate. On the other, by abandoning its sovereignty to another power, such as Eurasia or Finland itself, Karjala may be able to achieve some degree of prosperity."
 KAR_duma: "卡累利阿杜马"
 KAR_duma_desc: "To another hundred years!\n\nThe Karelian Duma, a self-proclaimed successor assembly to that of the Russian Federation, resides in the desolate reaches of the far North. Isolated from the bulk of former revolutionary forces in Siberia, the situation in Karelia worsens by the day. Constant equipment shortages, corruption, ethnic tensions between Slavs and migrating Finnish tribes have taken their toll on the rump state.\n\nDue to the Byzantine politics of the Republic, the Duma has no president or acting representative - instead, every member is entitled to a vote and theoretically represents a region of old Russia - even if they had never been there. Decision-making is only possible due to the shared hatred of Eurasia, which sits over the lake, bidding its time until Karelia is starved out. The Duma has other plans."

 KAR_keepers_of_revolution_desc: "现立于卡累利阿之上的俄罗斯共和国是失败的2156共和革命的产物。曾控制了旧俄国与西伯利亚绝大多数地区的革命已经加强了在卡累利阿半岛的防御，等待着莫斯科政权的进攻。但随着欧亚国愈发强大，俄罗斯共和国必须尽快发动进攻，不然就只能一死了之了。"
 KAR_finno_slavic_tension: "Finno-Slavic Tensions"
 KAR_finno_slavic_tension_desc: "The Karelian lands have long been emptied of their namesake population - what is left are squabbling tribes of Slavs and Finnish refugees fleeing from the West. National divisions are high, and although the Republic preaches peace between the two groups, daily brawls and shootouts are not an uncommon sight."
 karelia_event.1.t: "From Federation To Union"
 karelia_event.1.d: "The Russian Republican Revolution gambled and lost. The Eurasian Union State, founded shortly after the Great Mistake, made great strides in reasserting control over Eastern Europe. The states of Ukraine and Belarus, crippled by the collapse of European economies, folded quickly.\n\nBut Russian fascist was not established. In a move of supreme stupidity, the old Federation rebranded into Eurasia, encouraging non-Russian politicians and granting autonomy rights to minorities. While a commendable act in theory, Eurasia betrayed its roots and decentralized the country to a crippling level. All of its disasters, from the Central Asian Campaign to anarchy, are surely the product of a lack of central authority."
 karelia_event_option.1.a: "Grave mistakes"
 karelia_event.2.t: "The State of Karelia"
 karelia_event.2.d: "The Kazakhs kicked in the door back in 2156, albeit without fully realizing it. In 2154, the Eurasian Union State, suffering from famines and stagnation, invaded Central Asia to dominate its resource centers and gain control over Aral Sea irrigation. The war was meant to be a quick march from Outer Orenburg to Tashkent, but logistical issues and low morale dragged the war across two years. Worse yet, the Central Asian states united to survive, eventually driving back Eurasian armies and leading to the Great Rout of Army Group South into the Urals.\n\nIt was in 2156 that the Republican Revolution exploded. Our predecessors marched on the Core, rallying across many cities. Alas, Eurasia withstood the Revolution and we were scattered by shock troops retreating from the front. By the end of the decade, cities like Omsk were lost to the Asians and the Urals fell into anarchy."

 karelia_event.3.t: "Throwing A Light"
 karelia_event.3.d: "Revolutionary remnants were split: the vast majority of our supporters, including soldiers and protestors, chose to flee to Siberia rather than face Moscow's wrath. There they remain today, isolated and assaulted by hordes of Chinese immigrants fleeing the floods. Meanwhile, Eurasia licks its wounds. The countryside of old Russia is destroyed, commanded by bandit kings and still stuck in the 21st century.\n\nBut in Karelia, the leadership of the Revolution has made its stand. Our situation is perilous, but we will prevail. Millions of Finns have fled East following Helsinki's demise, leading to rising ethnic tension. Due to this, we have been forced to cede much political power to these immigrants, and if we fail to enter Moscow, they may attempt an overthrow of the government. We lack time, industry, manpower, everything. Eurasia, while weak, grows stronger by the day. We must fight or die."

 karelia_event.5.t: "俄国已入我手！"
 karelia_event.5.d: "俄罗斯共和革命终于胜利了。在度过战火纷飞的岁月，付出人民的鲜血，以及城市的破败后，一切终焉。俄国主要地区已入我手，政府也将在合适时机从卡累利阿迁回莫斯科。还有许多事物要干——让俄罗斯从废墟中崛起，结束乌拉尔无政府状态，还有与我们的西伯利亚兄弟和统——之后我们就可以目光放远，看向剧变的世界。不过，今天是个好日子。我们已迈出俄罗斯复兴漫漫征途上的第一步。今天将在我们祖国父亲的履历上留下光辉的一笔。"
 karelia_event_option.5.a: "光荣啊，俄罗斯！"
 karelia_event.6.t: "你我之志"
 karelia_event.6.d: "Before the Great Mistake, Russia was a superpower. The biggest country on Earth, with the biggest military, stretching from Poland to Manchuria. We were the bastion of science, the first country to go into space, leading dozens of younger nations to a brighter future. At least, it's one way to look at our history - some refer to it as a decadent, oppressive empire, that collapsed into itself time after time because of its own destructive nature. Currently, the government is disunited on this issue. If we consider our past glorious, we'll try to bring it back - creating a strong, centralized state that will retake both core Russian land, and bring our former subjects back into the fold. To wage war in the 23rd century is hard, and we had problems controlling even a third of Russia! Evaluation of this plan ranges from wishful thinking and idealism to downright insanity, from the second wing of our Duma. They claim that the only part forward for Russia is focusing on our own country, and cooperating with the West to do so, perhaps even joining a major European alliance, holding a free election, and establishing a genuine, pluralist democracy first and foremost. After rounds of heated debate, our conclusion is…"

 karelia_event_option.6.b: "Fight for a Better Russia! Reject our greed!"
 karelia_event.7.t: "Our European Friends"
 karelia_event.7.d: "With our course finally decided, Russia is at crossroads once again. It is obvious that we must pick one of the European forces to align ourselves with, and after some evaluation, we found two fitting candidates. First, Germany and its INTEGR. Focused on ecology and diplomacy, they will be of a great help reconstructing Russia, and are perhaps the most progressive political block at this moment. And second, the North Sea Alliance. Led by Scotland, their main objective is reclaiming land lost to Great Mistake, and creating cities floating on water - ARKs. Both of those options will be essential in our rebirth, and change our politics greatly."
 karelia_event_option.7.a: "INTEGR is a better option"
 karelia_event_option.7.b: "We should petition to enter The North Sea Alliance"

 heirs_of_russia_desc: "Karelia finds itself in a difficult situation. On the one hand, the Finnish population is growing and immigrant communities are becoming restless. Already, minor terrorist attacks have taken place on government offices. Brawls between Russians and Finns are a common sight. The immigrants are demanding more representation in government, which may be the death of the Russian Republican Revolution.\n\nTo counteract popular discontent, Karelia prepares for war against Eurasia. Indeed, the Karelian peninsula was always meant to be a springboard for a full reclamation of old Russia. But the Republic will have to strike soon and strike fast for the Union State is growing exponentially stronger by the day."
