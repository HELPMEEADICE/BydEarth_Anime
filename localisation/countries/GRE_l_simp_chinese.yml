 greek_event.1.t: "选择一方"
 greek_event.1.d: "即便在“大灾变”之后，希腊在欧洲其他事务中仍然相对孤立。其主要贸易伙伴一直是中东和巴尔干联邦，尽管意大利最近的重新动员也提供了利润丰厚的贸易。希腊在22世纪挑起的唯一重大军事冲突是在与土耳其驻军发生短暂冲突后全面占领塞浦路斯，以及成功打击地中海海盗的反匪行动。\n\n然而，随着23世纪的到来，很少有分析家预计欧洲的和平会永远持续下去。如果其中一个主要同盟战胜其他同盟，它肯定会席卷欧陆的其他地区。为了确保持续的和平与在太空竞赛中的潜在地位，希腊必须与现有的大国集团结盟。然而，一旦希腊选择加入了一个同盟，它就不可能离开那个同盟。"

 greek_event.2.t: "Successful Land Reclamation Near Thessaloniki"
 greek_event.2.d: "It’s hard to know what’s true in this new, modern world, especially when all information is distributed by governments, and is shared at regional levels at best. Greece is no exception - all information about topics such as history, politics, and news around the world exists only in the form of datalinks, and, according to them, Greece is undoubtedly the greatest of all Balkan countries, maybe even number one in the whole world. Its wise leadership has led it through tumultuous centuries into a golden age, and even though the Great Mistake hit nations relying on sea trade and vast shores the hardest, it is still going strong, and reclaiming lost territories at an unbelievably fast pace! Some scholars heavily doubt and even deny this version of events, with many foreign media outlets questioning their authenticity. Historical revision and idealised outlooks have become the norm in Greece."
 greek_event_option.2.a: "What you don’t know can’t hurt you"
 greek_event.3.t: "Hellenic Revisionism"
 greek_event.3.d: "Climate change in the last centuries has affected all of the world, with rising sea levels taking over coasts, farmlands, and entire cities. Thessaloniki was one of the affected regions, with outer borders of it turning into wetlands. Greece's government efforts of draining the water there were successful. All of the affected land was successfully reclaimed, and ready for construction and resettlement."

 GRE_heart_of_old_athens: "Heart Of Old Athens"
 GRE_heart_of_old_athens_desc: "Greece is home to one of the oldest civilizations on the European continent. Its people are the proud owners of a rich history that spans entire millenniums. The ruins of long dead rulers overshadow the modern network nodes and high-tech construction facilities. Schools teach ancient history alongside augmentation, and whatever small tourism industry still exists in Europe has been virtually monopolized by Greece. The mountainous terrain of this nation has also allowed it to survive the floods of water and refugees, leaving it in a position of relative strength."
