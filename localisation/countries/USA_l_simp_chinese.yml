 USA_ulrik_svensgaard: "乌尔里克·司文斯噶德"
 USA_ulrik_svensgaard_purity_desc: "乌尔里克·司文斯噶德出生于2158年，其父是纽芬兰当地的一介渔夫，而其身为外籍流亡者后裔的母亲则是马萨诸塞州的一个酒保。司文斯噶德早年一直追随其父脚步，直到他突然在2176年参加了联邦海军，这导致他与家人从此产生了无法修复的隔阂。他在打击大西洋海盗的巡逻任务中表现出色，为自己赢得了候补军官学校的一席之地，并最终被任命为大卫·卡梅伦·希尔斯号航母战斗群的领航员。\n\n在灾难性的2187年巴芬湾海战中，希尔斯号遇袭殉爆，司文斯噶德单枪匹马救出了被困在甲板下的克拉克旗舰司令和其他三名高级军官，代价则是他的左眼。由于此等英雄事迹，他可以在海军政府内任选一个心仪职务，司文斯噶德开玩笑地要求就任总统（他宣称在他的领导下，联邦海军将不会全速驶向全军覆没的下场），然后他就被提名为共和党-民主党联盟的总统候选人了，这相当于仍处于震惊中的司文斯噶德已然开始了他的任期。虽然这一事件体现了自2084年华盛顿之围后联邦政府已经近乎绝望，但并不能因此否定司文斯噶德自身适合成为一名领导者的优势造就了他的新职位。\n\n有赖于其坚定不移的决心与自力更生的精神，司文斯噶德以自己的方式征服了诸多困难。他对于自己卑微的出身十分敏感，而且似乎很乐于让那些自认为在血统或资历高人一等的人士难堪。他十分自信，但面对同僚时总是彬彬有礼，并遵循着一种骑士精神，哪怕是对敌人——当然前提是他觉得敌人配被尊重。他从不寻衅滋事，但若作出承诺，必将一言九鼎、掷地有声。"
 USA_ulrik_svensgaard_divinity_desc: "When it came time to ask if weapons are more important than the world itself, Svensgaard surprisingly felt a soft spot for the wide-eyed kids who said they could make the very oceans something worth swimming in again. Perhaps it was because they were down in the dirt and mud where most Republicans wouldn't dare get their sleeves scuffed, maybe it was because he wasn't willing to give the brass any more pull than they already had, but Svensgaard has decided that the new America would be a greener America.  His new Democratic allies have promised him to make sure his forces will be at the top of their game; when it comes to reclaiming America, they'll have to be!"
 USA_ulrik_svensgaard_mastery_desc: "When it came time to choose between faith and firepower, Svensgaard has chosen Republican weapons tech over Democratic preaching.  Having told the tree-huggers to take a vacation at INTEGR's Germany, Svensgaard is now flush with technicians, entrepreneurs, and more officers than you can shake a stick at. Though there are times where he is irritated at their preening, and misses the days where every man personally held the trigger they were firing, Svensgaard does have to admit that robotic soldiers can compensate for the Federal government's woefully small population. He just hopes he didn't put all his eggs into a soon-to-be-recalled basket."

 us_junta.1.t: "Raven Head Bay"
 us_junta.1.d: "It’s been over 100 years since the US Government was forced off of the mainland, forced to set up home in their former territories and forced to merely watch as their homeland was torn apart by maniacs and opportunists. Despite this brutal experience, the last Americans in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and Puerto Rico are still hopeful that they can retake what was lost. None of them believe this more than their leader, Admiral Ulrik Svensgaard.\n\nUlrik Svensgaard stood on Raven Head Bay, Nova Scotia. Looking out across the water, he could see the mainland from where he stood. He laid his eyes upon the shores of New England, or as the traitors would put it, “District 3.” Nary a single house stood above one story high, and nary a man stood above cover, lest he be a target for snipers. Bluehelmets and Public Safety Forces fought over scraps of ruined land that used to be under one banner, one flag, one glorious nation. But of course, Ulrik doesn’t remember what America was before the collapse, nor does anyone else in the US Naval Territories, however he can still imagine what it was like. The golden fields of Elysium on Earth, a global hyperpower that spread democracy and freedom across an Earth where tyrants used to reign. Ulrik can’t help but compare the supposed world the old Americans came into with the world his Americans will come into, a world divided among tyrants and brutalizers who lost any sense of morality long before they found a justification for it. The only way this global tyranny will end is when America retakes its vital place in the world, as protectors of the little man, of the free man, protectors of every man on this planet."

 us_junta.2.d: "”Good morning citizens of America! You may be wondering why you’re receiving this message through the datalinks today, let me first remove any doubt or panic you may have in your mind about this message. We are not under attack. That would mean that we are cowards, waiting for the traitors to take the fight to us! No. We are taking the fight to them!” Ulrik slammed the desk in front of him and stared deep into the camera. “You are needed! Every able body is needed on the frontlines or in a fleet! It is only with the grit and determination of every single one of you that we will retake our home!”\n\nUlrik stopped talking for a moment or two, struggling to speak the archaic American language that his forefathers used for speeches such as this. “Let me abandon the old speak and speak to all Americans as clearly as possible.” Ulrik proclaimed, ditching the old language he had previously been using. A silent gasp bounced around the camera crew as the speech reached the moment everyone was waiting for.\n\n”We are formally declaring war on the traitors of New England and the American Reclamation Corporation, we call on all men and women in New England and Arcopolis to rebel, and revolt, just as our ancestors did against their oppressors! We are coming to save you from tyranny and to give you freedom.” Ulrik stood up and gave a salute to the camera.\n\n”God Save America.\""
